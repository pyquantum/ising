# Ising formulations of many NP problems

The Ising formulation of "nondeterministic polynomial-time" (NP)-complete and NP-hard problems allows physics-based solutions to such problems by finding the ground state of a corresponding Ising spin system. In this repository, we follow Andrew Lucas' work on Ising formulations of NP-complete and NP-hard problems [https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005) and provide code to convert standard NP-hard problems such as SAT or MaxCut to Ising Hamiltonians.
